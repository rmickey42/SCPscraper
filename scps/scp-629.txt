Item #: SCP-629

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-629 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-629 may only be taken apart during routine testing. Once per day, SCP-629 is to be provided with the materials it uses to maintain itself. As of current regulations on "Misters", SCP-629 is to be contained in Hall ██ of Site-██.

Description: SCP-629 is a humanoid automaton, 1.7 meters tall and weighing 500 kilograms. SCP-629's body has been constructed out of ornate brass replications of human body parts. SCP-629's components require daily maintenance, which only it can perform. The words "Mr. Brass, from Little Misters® by Dr. Wondertainment" have been embossed into SCP-629's back. This designation appears as "8" in Document SCP-909-a.

SCP-629's body has been constructed in such a way that every portion of it is removable and interchangeable. These parts can be removed without causing SCP-629 any damage, although it expresses minor discomfort when these parts are being removed. Additionally, the parts that have been removed from SCP-629 can be re-assembled into new areas. Testing has shown that the number of ways SCP-629 can be theoretically rearranged is approximately 73.4 billion different combinations. SCP-629 is capable of controlling these new constructions on its body, but expresses extreme discomfort from these areas of its body.

SCP-629 was recovered from a facility believed to have been controlled by the Church of the Broken God. SCP-629 was recovered in a raid on this Church property after reports of suspicious activity in the area were confirmed. It was located in the central antechamber as Church members attempted to integrate it into several other objects. It is believed that SCP-629 was being held at this facility due to Church members believing it was a portion of their 'god'. Interviews with SCP-629 have confirmed this. SCP-629 claimed that it at first allowed their beliefs to persist, as it believed that they would provide it with some level of safety. Church members located at this facility have been terminated as of ██/██/1995, and SCP-629 has been classified as Safe.

ADDENDUM 629-A: This note was found on SCP-629's person during initial containment.
